Question: Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
Answer: Compared to the accuracy of roughly 0.31 produced with Naïve Bayes, the Linear SVM method achieved a greater accuracy of approximately 0.68. Thus, in this comparison, the Linear SVM algorithm performs best in terms of accuracy. "The Linear SVM model outperforms Naïve Bayes with higher accuracy and better balance across performance metrics," the author writes. Because Naïve Bayes presupposes feature independence, it might not hold in this case. With greater accuracy and balanced performance across classes in the 'glass' dataset, the Linear SVM is a superior option for this task due to its capacity to manage complicated relationships."
